# Thread Synchroniser

:wave: Welcome to my ```Thread Synchroniser``` project. This project aims to illustrate how to synchronize threads via mutexes, condition variables and more!

## What is this useful for?

Sometimes threads cannot run completely independent but must be synchronized by other threads, due to dependencies. This example highlights how to do this in an easy to use manner.

## Installation

This project is compatible with CMake.
